# Why choose RocketMQ

## Why RocketMQ
During the early stages of RocketMQ's development at Alibaba, we utilized it for a multitude of purposes, including asynchronous communications, search, social networking activity flows, data pipelines, and trade processes. As our trade business grew, we noticed that the messaging cluster was under increasing pressure.

After observing and analyzing the performance of the ActiveMQ IO module, we identified a bottleneck as the number of queues and virtual topics increased. We attempted to address this issue through various methods, such as throttling, circuit breakers, and service downgrades, but none proved satisfactory. We also considered using Kafka, a popular messaging solution, but it did not meet our requirements for low latency and high reliability, as explained below. As a result, we made the decision to develop a new messaging engine capable of handling a wider range of use cases, from traditional pub/sub to high-volume, real-time, zero-error transaction systems.

Since its inception, Apache RocketMQ has been widely adopted by enterprise developers and cloud vendors due to its simple architecture, rich business functionality, and extreme scalability. After more than a decade of extensive scenario polishing, RocketMQ has become the industry standard for financial-grade reliable business messages and is widely used in Internet, big data, mobile Internet, IoT, and other fields.
